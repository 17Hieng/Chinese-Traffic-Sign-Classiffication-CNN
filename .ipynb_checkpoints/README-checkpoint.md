# Chinese Traffic Sign Classification 
- Model trained based on TSRD trainning set (http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html)
- 98% overall accuracy on TSRD test set
- % on CATSAD dataset
- Able to classify 58 types of traffic sign
- External Test set adopted from [@icfaust](https://github.com/icfaust) via https://github.com/icfaust/CATSAD and modified to adapt 58 classes.
